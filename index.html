                <h3>HISTORY OF MEDICURE</h3>
                <p>During the past 150 years, two factors have shaped the modern public health system:
                    first, the growth of scientific knowledge about sources and means of controlling disease; 
                    second, the growth of public acceptance of disease control as both a possibility and a public responsibility.<br><br>
                    In earlier centuries, when little was known about the causes of disease, society tended to regard illness with a degree of resignation, and few public actions were taken. 
                    As understanding of sources of contagion and means of controlling disease became more refined, more effective interventions against health threats were developed. 
                    second, the growth of public acceptance of disease control as both a possibility and a public responsibility.<br><br>
                    Public organizations and agencies were formed to employ newly discovered interventions against health threats. 
                    As scientific knowledge grew, public authorities expanded to take on new tasks, including sanitation, immunization, regulation, health education, and personal health care. 
                    The link between science, the development of interventions, and organization of public authorities to employ interventions was increased public understanding of and social commitment to enhancing health. 
                    The growth of a public system for protecting health depended both on scientific discovery and social action. 
                    second, the growth of public acceptance of disease control as both a possibility and a public responsibility.<br><br>
                    Understanding of disease made public measures to alleviate pain and suffering possible, and social values about the worthiness of this goal made public measures feasible. 
                    The history of the public health system is a history of bringing knowledge and values together in the public arena to shape an approach to health problems</p>
